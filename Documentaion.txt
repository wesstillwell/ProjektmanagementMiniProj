- Worked through tutorial of travis
- Issues with installation of ngm packets, yet resolved
- Introduction finished

- Setup c# project
- Changed the .yml config for .net no mono
- Quick c# code that wouldnt compile and pushed
- Moved .sln file to root of repository
- A few git issues arrose
- Build failed, just as expected
- Fixed mistake
- Build still failed online
- Travis .yml file was not updating
- Finaly updated with a delay (ca 5 mins or so)
- Build successfull


Summary:
- might use travic for larger projects (e.g. mmp)
- very not useful for small projects.
- had to install ubuntu subsystem first before working on tutorial and had issues with ngm installation, took forever to fix
